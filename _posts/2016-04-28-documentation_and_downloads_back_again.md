After being offline for quite some time the downloads as well as all of the documentation is coming back up again.

These were hosted on the last Vodafone/Wayfinder servers that stayed around for quite some time after the company was closed down, due to other commitments no one was available to bring them back up again. The documentation has been converted partly automatically and partly manually to markdown. The blog and documentation is hosted using github pages and generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Downloads are partially hosted as github pages but some were moved to a git repo.

The rest of the docs and files will be coming online during the next few days.
